Create nice directory listings for s3 buckets using only javascript and HTML.

The listing can be deployed on any site and can also be deployed into a bucket.

Inspiration from http://aws.amazon.com/code/Amazon-S3/1713

## Live Demo

If you want to see an example of this script in action check out:

<http://data.openspending.org/>

## Usage

Copy these 4 lines into the HTML file where you want the listing to show up:

    <div id="navigation"></div>
    <div id="listing"></div>

    <!-- add jQuery - if you already have it just ignore this line -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

    <!-- the JS variables for the listing -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // var S3BL_IGNORE_PATH = true;
      // var BUCKET_NAME = 'BUCKET';
      // var BUCKET_URL = 'https://BUCKET.s3-REGION.amazonaws.com';
      // var S3B_ROOT_DIR = 'SUBDIR_L1/SUBDIR_L2/';
      // var S3B_SORT = 'DEFAULT';
      // var EXCLUDE_FILE = 'index.html';  // change to array to exclude multiple files
      // var AUTO_TITLE = true;
      // var S3_REGION = 's3'; // for us-east-1
    </script>

    <!-- the JS to the do the listing -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://rufuspollock.github.io/s3-bucket-listing/list.js"></script>

We've provided an example [index.html][index] file you can just copy if you want.

## How it works

The script downloads your XML bucket listing, parses it and simulates a webserver's text-based directory browsing mode.


#### `S3BL_IGNORE_PATH` variable

Valid options = `false` (default) or `true`

Setting this to false will cause URL navigation to be in this form:
- _`http://data.openspending.org/worldbank/cameroon/`_

You will have to put the html code in your page html AND your error 404 document.

Setting this to true will cause URL navigation to be in this form:
- _`http://data.openspending.org/index.html?prefix=worldbank/cameroon/`_


#### `BUCKET_URL` variable

Valid options = `''` (default) or your _bucket URL_, e.g.

`https://BUCKET.s3-REGION.amazonaws.com` (both http & https are valid)

- Do __NOT__ put a trailing '/', e.g. `https://BUCKET.s3-REGION.amazonaws.com/`
- Do __NOT__ put S3 website URL, e.g. `https://BUCKET.s3-website-REGION.amazonaws.com`

This variable tells the script where your bucket XML listing is, and where the files are.
If the variable is left empty, the script will use the same hostname as the _index.html_.


#### `BUCKET_NAME` variable

Valid options = `''` (default) or your _bucket name_, e.g.

`BUCKET`

This option is designed to support access to S3 buckets in non-website mode,
via both path-style and virtualhost-style access urls simultaneously, from the
same index.html file.

> NOTE: It is *not* recommended to use both BUCKET_URL and BUCKET_NAME in the
same index.html file.

See the [Amazon
Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html)
for details on the different url access formats.

The tables below attempt to highlight how BUCKET_NAME affects configuration and
use cases.

*Without using BUCKET_NAME:*

Configuration | Result | Link
------------ | ----------- | --------
bucket_url is `undefined`; access url is virtualhost-based | Success | [link](http://listing-test.s3.amazonaws.com/index-null.html)
bucket_url is `undefined`; access url is path-based | Error (Ok, expected) | [link](http://s3.amazonaws.com/listing-test/index-null.html)
bucket_url is virtualhost-based; access url is virtualhost-based | Success | [link](http://listing-test.s3.amazonaws.com/index-vh.html)
bucket_url is virtualhost-based; access url is path-based | Error (Fail) | [link](http://s3.amazonaws.com/listing-test/index-vh.html)
bucket_url is path-based; access url is virtualhost-based | Error (Fail) | [link](http://listing-test.s3.amazonaws.com/index-path.html)
bucket_url is path-based; access url is path-based | Success | [link](http://s3.amazonaws.com/listing-test/index-path.html)

*Using BUCKET_NAME to address the two failing configurations from above:*

Configuration | Result | Link
------------ | ----------- | --------
bucket_name is set; access url is virtualhost-based | Success | [link](http://listing-test.s3.amazonaws.com/index-bucketname.html)
bucket_name is set; access url is path-based | Success | [link](http://s3.amazonaws.com/listing-test/index-bucketname.html)


#### `S3B_ROOT_DIR` variable

Valid options = `''` (default) or `'SUBDIR_L1/'` or `'SUBDIR_L1/SUBDIR_L2/'` or etc.

- Do __NOT__ put a leading '/',     e.g. `'/SUBDIR_L1/'`
- Do __NOT__ omit the trailing '/', e.g. `'SUBDIR_L1'`

This will disallow navigation shallower than your set directory.

Note that this only disallows navigation to shallower directories, but __NOT__ access. Any person with knowledge of the existence of bucket XML listings will be able to manually access those files.

Use Amazon S3 permissions to set granular file permissions.


### `BUCKET_WEBSITE_URL` variable

This variable is optional.  It allows you to modify the host used for link hrefs.  You may want to use this if you have a custom domain name for your S3 bucket, or if you want to leverage things like "virtual files" (like 301 redirects).

Normally your links will point to `<BUCKET_URL>/<KEY>`.  If specified, your links will point to `<BUCKET_WEBSITE_URL>/<KEY>` (but the list API calls will still use the configured `BUCKET_URL`);


### `S3B_SORT` variable

This will sort your bucket listing. Variable options should be self-explanatory.

Valid options:

- `OLD2NEW`
- `NEW2OLD`
- `A2Z`
- `Z2A`
- `BIG2SMALL`
- `SMALL2BIG`


### `EXCLUDE_FILE` variable

This variable is optional.  It allows you to exclude a file (e.g. index.html) or a list of files from the file listings.


### `AUTO_TITLE` variable

This variable is optional.  It allows you to automatically set the title.


### `S3_REGION` variable

This variable is optional.  It allows you specify the S3 region that the bucket is in so that the BUCKET_URL and BUCKET_WEBSITE_URL variables will be configured automatcially.

The 'us-east-1' region is unique and would require this variable be set to 's3' for a bucket in that region, buckets in other regions would just have this set to 's3-' + their region name (e.g. 's3-eu-west-1').

E.g. setting S3_REGION to 's3' for a bucket named 'www.example.com' in the us-east-1 region would automatically set:

  BUCKET_URL = 'http://www.example.com.s3.amazonaws.com'
  BUCKET_WEBSITE_URL = 'http://www.example.com'


## Four Valid Configurations

1. Embed into your website
2. Use Amazon S3 in website mode with URL navigation
3. Use Amazon S3 in website mode with prefix mode (ignore_path mode)
4. Use Amazon S3 in non-website mode



#### 1. Embed into your website

Mandatory settings:

```
      var S3BL_IGNORE_PATH = true;
      var BUCKET_URL = 'https://BUCKET.s3-REGION.amazonaws.com';
```

Copy the code into whatever file you want to act as your listing page.


#### 2. Use Amazon S3 in website mode with URL navigation

Mandatory settings:

```
      var S3BL_IGNORE_PATH = false;
      var BUCKET_URL = 'https://BUCKET.s3-REGION.amazonaws.com';
```

- Enable website hosting under `Static website hosting` in your S3 bucket settings.
- Under `Permissions` grant `Everyone` the `List` and `View` permissions.
- Under `Permissions` go to `Edit CORS Configuration` and add the configuration listed in the following section 'S3 website bucket permissions'
- Enter `index.html` as your `Index Document` and `Error Document`.
- Put _index.html_ in your bucket.
- Navigate to _`http://BUCKET.s3-website-REGION.amazonaws.com`_ to access the script.

The _`-website-`_ in the URL is important, as the non-website URL is what serves your XML Bucket List.

<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteEndpoints.html#WebsiteRestEndpointDiff>

A specific example for the EU west region:

* Website endpoint: _`http://example-bucket.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/`_
* S3 bucket endpoint (for RESTful calls): _`http://example-bucket.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/`_

Note that US east region is **different** in that the S3 bucket endpoint does not include a location spec but the website version does:

* Website endpoint: _`http://example-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/`_
* S3 bucket endpoint (for RESTful calls): _`http://example-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/`_


#### 3. Use Amazon S3 in website mode with prefix mode (ignore_path mode)

Mandatory settings:
```
      var S3BL_IGNORE_PATH = true;
      var BUCKET_URL = 'https://BUCKET.s3-REGION.amazonaws.com';
```
- Enable website hosting under `Static website hosting` in your S3 bucket settings.
- Enter `index.html` as your `Index Document` (Error Document is not required).
- Put _index.html_ in your bucket.
- Navigate to _`http://BUCKET.s3-website-REGION.amazonaws.com`_ to access the script.


#### 4. Use Amazon S3 in non-website mode

Mandatory settings:

```
      var S3BL_IGNORE_PATH = true;
      var BUCKET_NAME = 'BUCKET';
```

- Put _index.html_ in your bucket.
- Access the bucket via either the virtualhost- or path-style url:
  - https://BUCKET.s3-REGION.amazonaws.com
  - https://s3-REGION.amazonaws.com/BUCKET


## S3 website bucket permissions

You must setup the S3 website bucket to allow public read access.

* Grant `Everyone` the `List` and `View` permissions:
![List & View permissions](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/227505/2409362/46c90dbe-aaad-11e3-9dee-10e967763770.png)
 * Alternatively you can assign the following bucket policy if policies are your thing:

```
{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "*"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{your-bucket-name}/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

* Assign the following CORS policy

```
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```


## Enabling HTTPS

You MUST use config 1 or 4. Amazon S3 doesn't support HTTPS in website mode.

Use https for your BUCKET_URL.

For config 4, navigate to your index.html's full path using https, e.g. _`https://BUCKET.s3-REGION.amazonaws.com/index.html`_

To stop browser warnings about displaying insecure content in secure mode:
- Host the following 3 files in your website/bucket:
  - _list.js_
  - https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js
  - http://assets.okfn.org/images/icons/ajaxload-circle.gif
- Edit _index.html_ to point to your bucket's `jquery.min.js` & `list.js` file (using relative paths)
- Edit _list.js_ to point to your bucket's `ajaxload-circle.gif`

With config 4, you will then be utilising AmazonAWS' wildcard SSL (unfortunately it is SHA1 only).


### S3 Bucket https only permissions (ie. deny http access)

This is only possible for config 1 or 4.

Set the following bucket policy
```
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "HTTPSOnly",
			"Effect": "Deny",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "s3:*",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{your-bucket-name}/*",
			"Condition": {
				"Bool": {
					"aws:SecureTransport": false
				}
			}
		},
		{
			"Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "s3:GetObject",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{your-bucket-name}/*"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "AllowPublicList",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "s3:ListBucket",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{your-bucket-name}"
		}
	]
}
```
